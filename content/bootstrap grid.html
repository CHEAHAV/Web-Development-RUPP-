                <p class="pt-2">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is language for creating web pages and web applications. Web
                    browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into
                    multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                    included cues for the appearance of the document.

                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing the presentation of a document
                    written in HTML. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user
                    interfaces written in HTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain
                    XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. </p>

                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
                    JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm
                    language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has
                    an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions.

                    JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end
                    development only.
